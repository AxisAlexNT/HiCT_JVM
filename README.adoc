== Launching pre-built version

**NOTE: currently only Windows (tested on 10 and 11) and Linux (with `glibc`, common Debain/Ubuntu are OK, Alpine users are out of luck) are supported, native libraries for MacOS are not bundled in these builds. Only AMD64 platform is supported. On Windows you might need to install https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170[additional libraries]**.

1. Install Java 19 or newer (older versions won't be able to launch this code);
1. Make sure that `JAVA_HOME` variable points to the correct installation path (if you have multiple JREs or JDKs);
1. Download latest "fat" JAR from the https://github.com/ctlab/HiCT_JVM/releases[*Releases* page] in *Assets* section. Latest build will usually be on top, however the most stable implementation is in the build from `master` branch (called "Latest autogenerated build (branch master)"). You can rename it to `hict.jar` for convenience;
1. Open a terminal and change directory to where the downloaded `hict.jar` is located;
1. Issue `java -jar hict.jar` command and wait until message `Starting WebUI server on port 8080 ... WebUI Server started` appears;
1. Open your browser and navigate to the `http://localhost:8080` where HiCT WebUI should now be available.

=== Startup options

Currently, there are multiple environment variables that could be set prior to launching HiCT.

* `DATA_DIR` --- should be a path to the directory containing `.hict.hdf5`, `.agp` and `fasta` files. These files could be anywhere in subtree of this directory, it is scanned recursively.
* `VXPORT` --- should be an integer between `1` and `65535` denoting port number which will be served by HiCT API. Note that listening on ports below `4096` usually requires some kind of administrative privileges. If not provided, the default value is `5000`. Startup might fail if the port is already occupied by another service. Be sure to set correct port in Connection -> API Gateway field in HiCT WebUI if changed.
* `WEBUI_PORT` --- should be an integer between `1` and `65535` denoting port number which will be served by HiCT WebUI. Note that listening on ports below `4096` usually requires some kind of administrative privileges. If not provided, the default value is `8080`. Startup might fail if the port is already occupied by another service.
* `SERVE_WEBUI` -- should either be `true` or `false` telling whether to start serving HiCT WebUI on the desired port or not. Might be useful during debugging or when WebUI is served by another process. Default is `true`. This option does not have any effect in case WebUI is not packed into the jar file.
* `TILE_SIZE` --- should be an integer greater than one. Defines the default tile size for visualization. Experimental setting, currently might break WebUI renderer. Default is `256`. The greater the tile size is, the less tiles are shown on screen and therefore less requests are sent to the server, but each request could potentially take longer to process.

An example of launching HiCT with parameters:

==== *Linux, bash:*
```bash
DATA_DIR=/home/${USER}/hict/data SERVE_WEBUI=false java -jar hict.jar
```

==== *Windows, cmd:*
```cmd
set DATA_DIR="D:\hict\data"
set WEBUI_PORT="8888"
java -jar hict.jar
```

==== *Windows, PowerShell:*
```powershell
$env:DATA_DIR = "D:\hict\data"
$env:WEBUI_PORT = "8888"
java -jar hict.jar
```

==== Custom JVM Options

Of course, you can also pass JVM parameters like this:

```bash
DATA_DIR=/home/${USER}/hict/data SERVE_WEBUI=false java -ea -Xms512M -Xmx16G -jar hict.jar
```

=== Startup errors

Since library naming conventions are different for different platform and libraries, there is currently a mechanism to try and load each library under a different name. This CAN produce errors on server startup, you can ignore them if `Starting WebUI server on port 8080 ... WebUI Server started` message appeared in console.

If, however, server works but maps are not displayed in WebUI and an error sign displays at the bottom right corner of WebUI, you should check console for error output.

== Obtaining `.hict.hdf5` files

Currently, it's necessary to use https://github.com/ctlab/HiCT_Utils[`HiCT_Utils` package] for the file format conversion, there are plans to simplify this process.

== Building `HiCT_JVM` from source

To start building from source, you can run:
```
./gradlew clean build
```

Current progress on modifying HDF5 and JHDF5 configuration resides in https://github.com/AxisAlexNT/jhdf5-with-plugins-configuration-snapshot[my personal repository]. Modified configuration is necessary to rebuild native libraries (HDF5, HDF5 plugins and JHDF5 should all be build as dynamic libraries). However, prebuilt native libraries for AMD64 Windows and Linux platforms are already present in `HiCT_JVM` repository. Missing platforms are Linux on `armv7` and `aarch64` and MacOS (both `amd64` and `aarch64` variants).
